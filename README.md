# SolidRun Hummingboard Gadget Snap

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/ogra1/hummingboard-gadget.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/ogra1/hummingboard-gadget)

This repository contains the source for an Ubuntu Core gadget snap
for the SolidRun Hummingboard. Building it with snapcraft will
automatically pull, configure, patch and build the git.denx.de/u-boot.git
upstream source for `mx6cuboxi_defconfig` at release `v2017.01` and produce
a bootable gadget snap with the resulting binaries.

## Gadget Snaps

Gadget snaps are a special type of snaps that contain device specific support
code and data. You can read more about them in the snapd wiki
https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/wiki/Gadget-snap

## Building

### Natively on armhf

To build the gadget snap locally on a native armhf system just run `snapcraft`
in the toplevel of the tree.

### Cross on x86 systems

Copy the crossbuild-snapcraft.yaml over snapcraft.yaml and run `snapcraft`

```
cp crossbuild-snapcraft.yaml snapcraft.yaml
snapcraft
```
## Splash screen

The splashscreen has been created from a jpeg with the following line:

```
jpegtopnm splash.jpg | ppmquant 256 | ppmtobmp -bpp 8 >splash.bmp
```
